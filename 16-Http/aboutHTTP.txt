Everytime we type a url in the browser, we're requesting data from the
server.
Since we use HTTP protocol to send data between client and the server,
so we call them http request and http response.
So, the user sends a http request and server send an http response.
Servers are computers whose job is to ensure that the resource the client 
is requesting is available.
We can pass additional information with the request and response(http messages)
using headers(key-value pairs).
We have request methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to determine the type of
request we want to do from the server.
GET -> To get a resource. Default request we perform from the browser.
POST -> To create something new in the server. We need to send a body/payload as 
        request header to the server.
PUT -> To update something on the server. We need to send a body/payload to the server.
DELETE -> To delete something in the server.

Request headers -> Eg:- body or payload when we need to create something new on the server.
Response headers -> Status code to indicate what happened to the request(successful, error etc),
                    content-type(eg:- text/html or json)
We usually send json data and the client can handle it what to do with it.
